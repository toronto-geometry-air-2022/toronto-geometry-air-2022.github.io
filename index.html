      <p>
The University of Toronto geometry processing research group led by 
<a href=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/>Prof. Alec Jacobson</a> is
looking for technical art students to join us for an internship/artist-residency.
The resident will both experiment with & create new artwork using the
technologies developed by our researchers and inform & participate in our
development of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
      This <strong>12-week</strong> internship is hosted at the <a
        href=https://www.utoronto.ca/>University of Toronto</a> in Toronto,
      Canada.
      </p>

      <h2>What you will do:</h2>
      <p>
In collaboration with researchers at University of Toronto, create new physical
or digital artworks, stories, sculptures, or mixed media installations. Artwork
proposals should be informed by or made possible by new (or even
yet-to-be-discovered) geometry processing technologies. Recent examples of new
technologies developed by our research group include:
