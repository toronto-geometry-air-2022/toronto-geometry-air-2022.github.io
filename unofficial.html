      <p>
      The University of Toronto geometry processing research group led by <a
        href=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/>Prof. Alec Jacobson</a> is
      looking for technical artists to join us for an
      internship/artist-in-residence to experiment and create new artwork using
      the technologies developed by our researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
      This <strong>12-week</strong> internship is hosted at the <a
        href=https://www.utoronto.ca/>University of Toronto</a> in Toronto,
      Canada.
      </p>

    <div class="row">
      <h2>What you will do:</h2>
      <p>
In collaboration with researchers at University of Toronto, create new physical
or digital artworks, stories, sculptures, or mixed media installations. Artwork
should be informed and made possible by new technologies, such as those
developed in our research group. For example,
